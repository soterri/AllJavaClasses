To handle files in Java(import/export data or read and write files) we can use 2 classes:
FileInputStream to import data
FileOutputStream to export data

Using these classes we can read any type of files:
.txt files, .properties files, .xlsx files

Properties  file -is a file that has .properties extension 
and its stores data in form of key and value.
Serving as a configuration file, there we can place data that 
we will need to config our test execution. 
What kind of data?
to store our app url, database url, credentials to login apps, credentials to login databases

Why do we need it?
Property file mostly use to store configurations settings
to store browser, url, username, password, database url, database userName, database passWord.

To read/work with data from properties file:
We need properties class, bc properties class gives us many methods to work with 

extensions:
.txt
.xls
.xlsx - new version

first, a file, 2nd build obj of the file input stream, now depending on the different type of file,
we will be using different type of class, if using excel files will be using xssf workbook 

to read excel - use apache poi library
inside library collection of interfaces and classes

1. interface -> workbook and will have 2 implementation classes
xssfworkbook class - new workbook and HSSFWorkbook class


driver.get(read url from propfile);
driver.findElement(By.id("whatever string id that will be passed)).sendKeys("Admin12345");


Why do we need it?

to separate code from data, we will using configs for our apps to test
changing values in the configs without changing in source code


to test login
driver.findElement(By.id("").sendKeyd("user id from excel");
driver.findElement(By.id("").sendKeys("password from excel");
performing data driven testing - data will be driving my test
