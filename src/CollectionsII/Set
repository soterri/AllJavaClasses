Set Collection:

Set Collection does not allow for duplicate elements.

Classes that implement the Set interface is:
HashSet - order of the elements is not preserved
LinkedHashSet - order is preserved
TreeSet - ascending order (A,B,C order), does not allow for null values

Set does not have methods to retrieve elements from. 
so we retrieve elements using ITERATOR!

Set<String> set = new Set<>(); NO
cannot create an object of interface

List vs Set?
List is an ordered collection that allows for duplicate elements/objects
while set does not allow for duplicates and depends on which set you're using
that will store elements in order, in ascending order, or at random

How to remove duplicate elements from List? -> convert to set

How to retrieve single element from Set? -> convert to list

arrays is a utility class that has methods to work with arrays
Arrays.sort(array)

Collections is a util class that have methods to work with collections
