Set Collection:

Set Collection does not allow for duplicate elements.

Classes that implement the Set interface is:
HashSet - order of the elements is not preserved
LinkedHashSet - order is preserved
TreeSet - ascending order (A,B,C order), does not allow for null values

Set does not have methods to retrieve elements from. 
so we retrieve elements using ITERATOR!

Set<String> set = new Set<>(); NO
cannot create an object of interface
