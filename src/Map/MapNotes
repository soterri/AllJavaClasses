Map - a collection of ENTRY objects using a key+value pair that is not apart of the Collection Framework although the concepts are based on the 
collections framework. Map has its own methods to manipulate data with.

Classes that implement the Map interface is
HashMap - map in which order is not maintained

LinkedHashMap -  of key objects is maintained

TreeMap - map in which key objects will be stored in ascending order

HashTable - synchronized and outdated.

to store -- .PUT

to retrieve -- .GET

To retrieve all keys 
.keySet(); - returns a set of all keys from the map(keys must be unique)

To retrieve all values
.values(); returns a collection of values (values can be duplicate and they are not ordered).


to get an entry object  - we need to call the method entrySet(); --> a set of entry objects

entry will have methods
.getKey - returns key object
.getValue - returns value object
