Variables and methods defined inside the user class are class members

Methods: describes the behavior of the class, a block of code

Built In: limited and we cannot modify

User Defined: unlimited and modifiable

We can't create a method inside another method even the main method.

Methods:
With PARAMETERS
W/O parameters


Method WITH parameters
void methodName (String str){ 
		Sysout("Hello"+ str);
 
 When we call method we have to pass matching argument of the method
 and also we must follow the order of the defined parameters
 
 Method without any return value uses VOID keyword
 Method WITH return values uses RETURN keyword
