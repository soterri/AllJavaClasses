break and continue keyword can be used inside any loop
mostly it will be used within if statement

break vs continue

break - exits the loop
continue - skips current iteration

FOR LOOP - best choice to use when you know the number of iterations

WHILE/DO WHILE - best choice when you DO NOT know the number of iterations

FOR LOOP SYNTAX:
for(initialization/start point; condition/end point; increment/decrement)

		code;

	NESTED LOOP
	
	-Placing one loop inside the body of another loop is called nesting.
	-When we "nest" two loops, the outer loop takes control of the number of complete
	repetitions of the inner loop
	-While all types of loops may be nested, the most common one is FOR LOOP.
