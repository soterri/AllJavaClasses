features/attributes
actions

ex: car features/attributes: wheels, tires, windows, color, model, make, year, doors
action: drive, start, accelerate, stop, reverse

Class is a template to build objects. Inside the class we define features and behaviors of the object.
By using the template/blueprint we can build objects. And as many as we need/want.

Class is a LOGICAL entity whereas OBJECT is a PHYSICAL entity.

a class contains methods, constructors, variables

Class can have attributes and behaviors. In programming to define
attributes we use variables and to represent behavior we will be using 
methods

Variables and methods defined inside the class are class members
