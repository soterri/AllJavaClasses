Encapsulation:
In Java, a mechanism for wrapping the data(variables) and code acting
on the data(methods) together as a single unit. The variables of a class will be
hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through the methods of their current
class.

create private variables and only through public method you can access these private variables

Best example of Encapsulation is a class.
To create a tightly encapsulated class we need:
1 to create private data members(variables)
2. create public methods to get access to those variables(getters and setters)

How can we achieve data hiding?
by making the data private, to access the data, we have to use
public methods, and through public methods, you can get access to variables

To achieve ENCAPSULATION:
1. make fields/variables private
2. make public getters and setters to access those variables

Why do we need it?
for security purposes, protecting data.
