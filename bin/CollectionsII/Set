Set Collection:

Set Collection does not allow for duplicate elements.

Classes that implement the Set interface is:
HsshSet - order of the elements is not preserved
LinkedHashSet - order is preserved
TreeSet - ascending order (Abc order)

Set does not have methods to retrieve elements from. 
so we retrieve elements using ITERATOR!
