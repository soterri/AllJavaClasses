Encapsulation:
In Java, a mechanism for wrapping the data(variables) and code acting
on the data(methods) together as a single unit.

create private variables and only through public method you can access these private variables

Best example of Encapsulation is a class.
To create a tightly encapsulated class we need:
1 to create private data members(variables)
2. create public methods to get access to those variables(getters and setters)

How can we achieve data hiding?
by making the data private, to access the data, we have to use
public methods, and through public methods, you can get access to variables
