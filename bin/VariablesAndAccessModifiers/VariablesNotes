3 types of variables:
local
instance
static

LOCAL variables declared inside the class and inside the method.
The scope of the local variable is only within that method.


INSTANCE variables are declared inside the class but OUTSIDE of any method.
When we create an instance of each class(object of the class) a copy of each instance
variable will be given to each object (instance).

STATIC
- static variables defined inside the class but outside any method, constructor, or block.
- cannot be local
- create a single copy of static variable and share among all instances of the class
- belongs to the class rather than the instance
- when you want to have common properties that should be passed onto all the instances that are static
- can be used with variables, methods, and blocks
