Constructor: special method/block of code that is executed when we create 
an object/an instance of the class.

Constructor name is ALWAYS the same as class name.
if you do not provide a constructor, the compiler by default will create a non argument constructor 

NON-argument constructor
Argument/parameterized constructor

How to create a CONSTRUCTOR:
1. constructor name must be the same as class name
2. cannot have a return type, not even void

How a constructor is executed:
Every time when we create an object we call a constructor
and entire block of code inside the constructor will be executed first

WHY do we need a constructor?
Constructor initializes object
initialize instance variables



This KW:
used to refer to the current class instance/object
using THIS kw we can refer/access current class instance members/variables/methods

this.variableName -> refers to the instance variables.

If we have local variables and instance variables with the same name
THIS is used to differentiate b/w the local and instance variables.

Difference between Constructor and Methods
1. Constructor must have the same name as class, while method can have any name
2. Constructor must not have a return type not even void - using a return type will just make it a method
While method can have any return type
3. Constructors cannot use ant non access modifiers such as static, final, abstract while method can
4.Constructors are called automatically when obj/instance of the class is being created while method must be called

Similarities
1. both are blocks of codes that define functionality within a class
2. both are defined within a class and can operate on the data members of that class
3. both can have parameters or not
4. both can use access modifiers
5. both can be overloaded
