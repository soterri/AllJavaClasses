Inheritance 
single - 1 parent 1 child

multilevel - grandparent - parent - child

hierarchial- 1 parent multiple children 

Private variables and methods are not inherited so they will not be available or visible in the subclasses

Default variables and methods are available to the sub class only within the same package

Protected variable and methods are available to the sub class in the same pkg or different pkg via inheritance!

Can a constructor be inherited?
no, bc a constructor must have the same name as the class name
and a class has their own constructors that are made by the compiler by default

2 types of polymorphism

compile time/static binding/early binding/->method overloading
during compilation, you will know how obj will behave whether it will perform based on your methods with parameters
example: you have 2 methods with the same name with different parameters and you create an obj calling those methods
and 1 method has 2 parameters -> void sum(int a, int b) when you call the method the method with 2 arguments.
void sum(int a, int b, int c) --> class summ = new class(5,10,15); when calling a specific method you'll know which behavior which will be executed.

method overloading is when you have 2 or more methods in the same class with the same exact name but with different numbers or types of parameters

overloading is acheived by passing different number parameters or types or parameters

runtime time/dynamic binding/late binding/method overriding



public access modifier
void - return type
add(int num1, int num2) - method + parameters = method signature
in method overloading method signature must always be different
