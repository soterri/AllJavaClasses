features/attributes
actions

ex: 
car features/attributes: wheels, tires, windows, color, model, make, year, doors
action: drive, start, accelerate, stop, reverse

Class is a template to build objects. Inside the class we define features and behaviors of the object.
By using the class template/blueprint we can build objects and as many as we need/want.

Class is a LOGICAL entity whereas OBJECT is a PHYSICAL entity.

a class contains methods, constructors, variables

Class can have attributes and behaviors. In programming to define
attributes we use variables and to represent behavior we will be using 
methods.

If we don't have a class than we cannot create an object

Variables and methods defined inside the class are class members	

We have class that serves as a template then based on the template 
we can create objects and through objects we can access variables and methods 
of that class. In programming, behaviors will be represented in the form of methods
and for attributes in the form of variables. We can define as many actions as we need.
in order for us to create an obj first we have to have a class to create that obj
thru the variable that is referring to the obj now we can access features/behaviors
of the obj. 

to access variables create obj of class
