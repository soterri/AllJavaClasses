WHILE LOOP SYNTAX
1. initialize variable (should be outside of loop)
2. while( test variable --> has to be true) {
	code;
	variable increment or decrement;
	
WHILE LOOP:
1. initialize variable
2. while condition
3. code inside loop gets executed
4. increment/decrement

WHILE WE CHECK CONDITION FIRST THAN EXECUTE BLOCK OF CODE

WHILE LOOP IS BEST CHOICE IF YOU DONT KNOW THE NUMBER OF ITERATIONS

DO WHILE - EXECUTES BLOCK OF CODDE FIRST THAN CHECKS CONDITION
EVEN IF CONDITION IS FALSE - IT WILL EXECUTE CODE AT LEAST ONCE

	DO WHILE
do while is similar to while loop
code will execute while condition is true
even if condition is false code will execute at least once
