int a =10;
a=a+1; - assignment
a+=1; shorthand assignment

Loops: to repeat same block of code

Loops:
while
do while
for
advanced for loop/enhanced loop/for each loop

WHILE LOOP SYNTAX
1. initialize variable (should be outside of loop)
2. while( test variable --> has to be true) {
	code;
	variable increment or decrement;
	
WHILE LOOP:
1. initialize variable
2. while (test variable --> true) THEN
3. code inside loop gets executed
4. increment/decrement
code will be looping until condition becomes false

WHILE - WE CHECK CONDITION FIRST THAN EXECUTE BLOCK OF CODE

DO WHILE - EXECUTES BLOCK OF CODE FIRST THAN CHECKS CONDITION
EVEN IF CONDITION IS FALSE - IT WILL EXECUTE CODE AT LEAST ONCE

	DO WHILE
do while is similar to while loop
code will execute while condition is true
even if condition is false code will execute at least once


DO WHILE

int num1=10 // 	1. initialize variable

do{
 Sysout("Bye") 1. execute code 
 
 num1++ //increment
 
 }while(num1<=7) // checks condition
